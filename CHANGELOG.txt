Most people know the REChain ®️ Platform as a secure collaboration and messaging app. They know what it looks like on their phone or laptop, appreciate that it’s end-to-end encrypted, and make increasing use of features like threads, polls and location-sharing.

Dream big! Stay safe! Stay true! Stay private! Stay tuned!

And have a great day!

Sincerely, Yours Mr. Detective Pikachu!

CHANGELOG:
