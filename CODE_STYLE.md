# Code Style Guide

This document outlines the coding conventions and best practices for developers contributing to the REChain project. Adhering to these guidelines ensures code consistency, readability, and maintainability across the codebase.

## General Principles

- Write clear, concise, and self-documenting code.
- Follow the language-specific style guides (e.g., Dart, Rust).
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Keep functions and methods small and focused on a single task.
- Avoid code duplication by reusing existing functions or creating new abstractions.

## Formatting

- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces for Dart, 4 spaces for Rust).
- Limit line length to 80-100 characters.
- Use blank lines to separate logical sections of code.
- Place opening braces on the same line as the declaration.

## Naming Conventions

- Use camelCase for variables and functions.
- Use PascalCase for class and type names.
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants.
- Avoid abbreviations unless widely understood.

## Comments and Documentation

- Write comments to explain why, not what.
- Use doc comments for public APIs and complex logic.
- Keep comments up to date with code changes.

## Error Handling

- Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful messages.
- Use exceptions or error types appropriate to the language.

## Testing

- Write unit tests for new features and bug fixes.
- Follow the project's testing framework and conventions.

## Tools

- Use linters and formatters configured for the project.
- Run tests and static analysis before submitting code.

Following these guidelines helps maintain a high-quality codebase and facilitates collaboration among contributors.
