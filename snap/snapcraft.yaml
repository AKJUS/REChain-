  ## REChain.Online comes with a dream!

  Imagine a world where everyone can choose the messenger they like and is still able to chat with all of their friends.

  A world where there are no companies spying on you when you send selfies to friends and lovers.

  And a world where apps are made for awesomeness and not for profit. â™¥
