description: |
  REChain ¬ÆÔ∏è ü™ê ‚ú® is an primarily designed as a security and privacy analysis analogue fully focused on the use of platform moments and messages for communication, built on a source code library, including those developed by us, for those who respect freedom and privacy, as well as the safety and security of personal data. üå§ Our task was to make a tool pleasant and enjoyable to use, with which each of you can communicate, expand content, create workspaces, organize a workflow. üåà We strive to show all the world's giants that it is possible to create cool products that are of great importance for society, for people to interact with each other, without selling advertising, personal data of users, their rights and freedoms! ü¶Ñ It's written in Flutter. Our mission is to create an easy to use instant messenger which is open source and accessible for everyone. Donate US! ‚åõ For tea, coffee! For the future of decentralized and distributed internet. We do cool and, in my opinion, useful things for the safety and security of users' personal data. And on a completely non-commercial basis! üòé Tether - (TRC20) - Tron üçï: TRZ7jyMBNtRtqokkkJ7g5BJDzFycDv8cBm - Join the community: https://matrix.to/#/#chatting:matrix.katya.wtf Website: https://rechain.online
