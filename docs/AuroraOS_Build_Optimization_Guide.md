# Building and Optimizing Flutter Apps for Aurora OS

## 1. Build Configuration

Aurora OS is Linux-based, so build your Flutter app targeting Linux desktop:

```bash
flutter config --enable-linux-desktop
flutter build linux --release
```

This produces optimized binaries for Aurora OS.

## 2. Performance Optimization Tips

- **Use Flutter's release mode** for best performance.
- **Minimize widget rebuilds** by using const constructors and efficient state management.
- **Optimize asset sizes** (images, fonts) to reduce memory usage.
- **Use deferred loading** for large libraries or features not immediately needed.
- **Profile your app** using Flutter DevTools to identify bottlenecks.
- **Leverage Aurora OS native features** via plugins for better integration and performance.

## 3. Packaging for Aurora OS

- Create `.desktop` files with appropriate permissions (network, bluetooth, etc.).
- Use RPM spec files with necessary BuildRequires and excludes (e.g., gstreamer).
- Follow Aurora OS packaging guidelines to create installable packages.

## 4. Deployment and Testing

- Deploy the built app to Aurora OS devices or emulators.
- Test input handling, plugin functionality, and UI responsiveness.
- Monitor resource usage and optimize as needed.

## 5. Continuous Integration

- Automate builds using CI pipelines targeting Aurora OS.
- Run automated tests and performance benchmarks.
