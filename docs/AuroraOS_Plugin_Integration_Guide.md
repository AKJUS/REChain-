# Aurora OS Plugin Integration Guide

## 1. Add Dependencies to pubspec.yaml

Add all plugin packages from the Aurora OS flutter-community-plugins repository as dependencies. Example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  background_tasker: ^1.0.0
  notificationer: ^1.0.0
  push_catcher: ^1.0.0
  call_api: ^1.0.0
  div_kit: ^1.0.0
  flame_engine_usage: ^1.0.0
  flutter_todo: ^1.0.0
  generator_pdf: ^1.0.0
  location_finder: ^1.0.0
  # Add other plugins similarly
```

## 2. Desktop Permissions Files (*.desktop)

Create desktop entry files for your app with required permissions. Example:

```ini
[Desktop Entry]
Name=YourAppName
Exec=your_app_executable
Icon=your_app_icon
Type=Application
Categories=Utility;
X-Aurora-Permissions=network;bluetooth;camera;microphone;
```

Adjust permissions as needed for your app and plugins.

## 3. RPM Spec Files (*.spec)

Add spec files for packaging with required rules. Example:

```
%global __requires_exclude ^lib(gstreamer-1.0)\.so.*$

BuildRequires: pkgconfig(gstreamer-1.0)
```

Include these lines in your spec files to handle dependencies properly.

## 4. Dart Code Implementation

Implement plugin initialization and usage in your Dart code as shown in the `lib/platform/aurora_plugins_integration.dart` example.

## 5. Systematic Integration

- Repeat steps 1-4 for all plugins in the Aurora OS flutter-community-plugins repository.
- Test each plugin integration individually and in combination.
- Update build and packaging scripts accordingly.

This guide helps ensure all plugins are properly integrated, permissions are set, and packaging is configured for Aurora OS.

For detailed plugin usage, refer to each plugin's documentation in the repository.
