## 🐦 Shorebird Integration (Code Push Updates)

This project uses **[Shorebird](https://shorebird.dev/)** for code push updates in Flutter apps.

### ⚙️ How to Install Shorebird CLI:
```bash
curl https://get.shorebird.dev | bash
export PATH="$HOME/.shorebird/bin:$PATH"
shorebird --version
```

### 🚀 Initialize Shorebird in This Project:
```bash
shorebird init
```

This command will:
- Set up Shorebird in the project.
- Add the required `shorebird_code_push` package.
- Configure native projects (`android`, `ios`, etc).

---

### 📲 Running the App with Shorebird:
In `lib/main.dart`:
```dart
import 'package:shorebird_code_push/shorebird_code_push.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await ShorebirdCodePush.instance.ensureInitialized();
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

---

### 🏗️ Building with Shorebird:
```bash
shorebird build apk
shorebird build ios
shorebird build appbundle
```

---

### ⚡️ Manual Update Control (Optional):
To manually control updates, edit `.shorebird/shorebird.yaml`:
```yaml
auto_update: false
```

Then, in your app:
```dart
final update = await ShorebirdCodePush.instance.checkForUpdate();
if (update != null) {
  await update.downloadAndInstall();
}
```

### Notes

- Test on a real device or emulator for best results.
- For packaging, see `aurora/rpm/com.rechain.dapp.spec`.
