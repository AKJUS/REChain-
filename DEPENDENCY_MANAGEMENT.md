# Dependency Management Guide for REChain

This guide outlines best practices and procedures for managing project dependencies in REChain.

## Overview

Managing dependencies effectively is crucial to maintain project stability, security, and ease of development.

## Dependency Types

- **Direct dependencies**: Libraries explicitly used by the project
- **Transitive dependencies**: Dependencies of dependencies
- **Dev dependencies**: Tools used during development (e.g., linters, test frameworks)

## Dependency Management Tools

- **Flutter/Dart**: `pubspec.yaml` and `pub` tool
- **Node.js**: `package.json` and `npm` or `yarn`
- **Python**: `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile`
- **Docker**: `Dockerfile` and image tags

## Best Practices

### Pin Dependency Versions

- Use exact versions or version ranges to avoid unexpected updates
- Example in `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
dependencies:
  http: ^0.13.0
```

### Regularly Update Dependencies

- Schedule regular updates to keep dependencies current
- Use tools like `pub outdated` to check for updates

### Use Dependency Lock Files

- Commit `pubspec.lock` to version control to ensure consistent installs

### Audit Dependencies for Security

- Use tools like `pub audit` or `npm audit`
- Monitor vulnerability databases

### Avoid Unnecessary Dependencies

- Keep dependencies minimal to reduce attack surface and bloat

### Use Dependency Overrides Sparingly

- Only override dependencies when necessary and document reasons

## Updating Dependencies

### Flutter/Dart

```bash
flutter pub upgrade
flutter pub get
```

### Node.js

```bash
npm update
npm install
```

### Python

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

## Handling Breaking Changes

- Review changelogs before updating
- Test thoroughly after updates
- Use feature branches for major upgrades

## Dependency Caching

- Use CI caching to speed up builds
- Cache `~/.pub-cache` for Dart/Flutter

## Managing Transitive Dependencies

- Use dependency resolution tools to identify conflicts
- Override versions if necessary with caution

## Dependency Documentation

- Document major dependencies and their purpose
- Keep track of licenses and compliance
