# REChain Project Architecture

## Key Components:
- **Consensus Layer**: REChain uses a [consensus mechanism] to validate transactions in a decentralized network.
- **REChain Node**: Every user can deploy a node to support the decentralized infrastructure.
- **Frontend (Flutter)**: Flutter is used to build cross-platform mobile and web interfaces for REChain services.
- **API & RPC Layer**: External applications can interact with REChain using APIs or remote procedure calls (RPC).

## Folder Structure:
- `/src`: Core Rust source code for REChain's backend.
- `/config`: Configuration files for setting up nodes.
- `/lib`: Core Dart/Flutter components for the front-end.
- `/test`: Unit tests for backend and frontend services.

## Flutter and Dart Integration:
- **UI Layer**: Built with Flutter widgets for a responsive user experience.
- **State Management**: REChain frontend uses [State Management Solution] (e.g., Provider, Riverpod).
- **API Integration**: The frontend communicates with the blockchain via REST APIs or gRPC.
