# Disaster Recovery Guide for REChain

This guide outlines the disaster recovery procedures for REChain systems.

## Disaster Types

### Natural Disasters
- Earthquakes, floods, hurricanes
- Power outages
- Internet connectivity issues

### Human-Caused Disasters
- Cyber attacks (ransomware, DDoS)
- Hardware failures
- Human error (accidental deletion)

### Technical Disasters
- Database corruption
- Application crashes
- Data center failures

## Recovery Objectives

### RTO (Recovery Time Objective)
- Time to restore system functionality
- Target: 4 hours for critical systems
- Target: 24 hours for non-critical systems

### RPO (Recovery Point Objective)
- Maximum acceptable data loss
- Target: 1 hour for critical data
- Target: 24 hours for non-critical data

## Recovery Strategies

### Backup and Restore
- Regular automated backups
- Offsite backup storage
- Encrypted backup files

### High Availability
- Load balancers
- Redundant servers
- Database replication

### Failover Systems
- Hot standby systems
- Cold standby systems
- Cloud failover

## Recovery Procedures

### Step 1: Assess the Situation
1. Identify the type and scope of the disaster
2. Notify stakeholders
3. Activate incident response team
4. Assess impact on users and business

### Step 2: Activate Recovery Plan
1. Follow predefined recovery procedures
2. Restore from backups
3. Verify system integrity
4. Test functionality

### Step 3: Communicate
1. Update stakeholders on progress
2. Provide status updates to users
3. Manage expectations

### Step 4: Restore Normal Operations
1. Monitor system performance
2. Validate data integrity
3. Decommission temporary systems
4. Conduct post-mortem analysis

## Recovery Plans by Component

### Database Recovery
```bash
# Stop application
systemctl stop rechain

# Restore from backup
psql -U rechain < backup.sql

# Start application
systemctl start rechain

# Verify data integrity
psql -U rechain -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;"
```

### Application Recovery
```bash
# Deploy from backup
git checkout backup-branch
docker-compose up -d

# Verify application health
curl -f https://api.rechain.network/health
```

### Infrastructure Recovery
```bash
# Restore from infrastructure as code
terraform apply

# Verify infrastructure
aws ec2 describe-instances
```

## Testing and Maintenance

### Regular Testing
- Quarterly disaster recovery drills
- Annual full system recovery tests
- Update recovery procedures based on lessons learned

### Plan Maintenance
- Review and update recovery plans annually
- Update contact information
- Test backup restoration procedures

## Communication Plan

### Internal Communication
- Incident response team
- Management
- Development team
- Operations team

### External Communication
- Users
- Customers
- Partners
- Media (if necessary)

### Communication Templates
```markdown
**Incident Update**

Status: [Active/Resolved]
Impact: [Description of impact]
ETA: [Estimated resolution time]
Updates: [Latest information]
```

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Incident Response Team
- Incident Commander: Overall coordination
- Technical Lead: Technical decisions
- Communications Lead: Stakeholder communication
- Recovery Lead: Execute recovery procedures

### Support Roles
- Legal: Compliance and legal issues
- PR: Media and public communication
- Customer Success: User communication

## Tools and Resources

### Monitoring Tools
- Nagios, Zabbix for system monitoring
- PagerDuty for alerting
- Slack for communication

### Recovery Tools
- Ansible for automated recovery
- Terraform for infrastructure recovery
- Docker for application recovery

### Documentation
- Recovery runbooks
- Contact lists
- Vendor contact information

## Lessons Learned

### Post-Mortem Process
1. Conduct blameless post-mortem
2. Identify root causes
3. Document lessons learned
4. Update procedures
5. Share knowledge with team

### Continuous Improvement
- Regular review of recovery procedures
- Update based on technology changes
- Incorporate lessons from incidents

## Compliance and Legal

### Regulatory Requirements
- Data retention policies
- Privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
- Industry-specific regulations

### Legal Considerations
- Data breach notification requirements
- Contractual obligations
- Insurance claims

## Best Practices

### Preparation
- Maintain up-to-date recovery plans
- Regular backup testing
- Team training and drills

### During Incident
- Follow established procedures
- Communicate clearly and frequently
- Document all actions taken

### After Incident
- Conduct thorough post-mortem
- Update plans based on lessons learned
- Share knowledge across organization
