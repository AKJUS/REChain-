# REChain Best Practices

## Development
- Follow Dart/Flutter best practices and use `flutter format .`.
- Write modular, testable, and well-documented code.
- Use clear commit messages and PR descriptions.
- Add/maintain tests for new features and bug fixes.

## Security
- Use strong authentication and encryption for all integrations.
- Regularly update dependencies and check for vulnerabilities.
- Report security issues privately (see SECURITY.md).

## Deployment
- Use CI/CD for automated builds and tests.
- Store secrets securely (never in code).
- Monitor deployments with Prometheus/Grafana.

## Community
- Be respectful and inclusive in all interactions.
- Help others and share knowledge in issues, PRs, and discussions.
