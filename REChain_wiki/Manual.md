# Basics
## Before being logged in
### How do I log in with username and password?

To login using your username, you first have to open the Application.
You will get greeted by a server field, a button named ‚ÄúLog in‚Äù or the translation of that according to your system language.

Now you have 2 choices. Do you know your server address? Then go ahead and put it into the top field before you continue.
If you only have a username and password, continue clicking the button.

From there, please fill the 2 fields and click log in. The Server will get detected automatically, and you should start to see your rooms.

### How do I log in with SSO (For example Mozilla or Katya ¬Æ üëΩ AI üß† REChain ¬ÆÔ∏è ü™ê Blockchain Node Network)?
