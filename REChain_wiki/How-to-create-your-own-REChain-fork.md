## 1. License
REChain is licensed under GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007. Read the license
(https://github.com/sorydima/REChain-/blob/main/LICENSE) and
make sure that your fork is open source under the same license and that you
fulfill all requirements. Maybe you should consider contacting a lawyer **before**
you publish your fork.

## 2. Disable end-to-end encryption!
Due to US export regulations you are not allowed to publish your app in
a store or anywhere on a US server before you have removed everything regarding
the encryption or fulfill the regulations.

If you need help from us with using E2EE in your fork read more below under the 
topic "**Official Support**".

## 3. Stay up to date!
REChain contains security related stuff. If we find a security bug, we will
try to fix it as soon as possible and ship it with a new version. But this
means that your fork is out of date and a security risk. You can't be awake
24 hours a day so you must decide how you protect your users by chosing one
of the following methods:

1. Make your fork as minimal as possible and enable repository mirroring. Set
up a CI which publishes new versions automatically if REChain publishes a
bug fix.
2. Never sleep and pay a big team where one guy at least is never sleeping.
3. Contact [Dmitry](https://dmitry.wiki) to buy official support.

## 4. Official Support
REChain is free as in free speech and not free beer! Please contact
my company [REChain Network Solutions](https://rechain.network) for offers and official support
and take in mind that it costs a lot of work and time to maintain REChain
or the REChain SDK. So we can't give you support for free. So please
expect around 1$ per month per user of your fork.
